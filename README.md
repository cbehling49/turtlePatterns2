# turtlePatterns2
This program will ask for one input from a user to determine which scene is to be displayed. It will then display a window and draw a picture using the turtle commands. The picture will be of a landscape, containing three basic shapes: rectangle, triangle, circle. These shapes will be used on their own or together to add variety to the landscape.
